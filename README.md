# Microbit-Car-Kit
This is the project that involves building and programming a small robotic car using the microcontroller, allow student built a fully autonomous micro-car with obstacle avoidance, line following and bluetooth remote control.
# Flash the Micro:bit
1. Connect Micro:bit via USB
2. Drag `microbit-car.hex` (in /firmware) onto the MICROBIT drive
# Required 2 Micro:bit hardware one work like Remote control and the other work like receiver (optional)
- Install `Microbit_Car_Remote.apk` from /app
- Pair via Bluetooth -> using provided micro:bit python's library bluetooth mode
